# ## Now you are ready to work with the CSV file titled <font color=red>event_datafile_new.csv</font>, located within the Workspace directory.  The event_datafile_new.csv contains the following columns: 
# - artist 
# - firstName of user
# - gender of user
# - item number in session
# - last name of user
# - length of the song
# - level (paid or free song)
# - location of the user
# - sessionId
# - song title
# - userId

# The image below is a screenshot of what the denormalized data should appear like in the <font color=red>**event_datafile_new.csv**</font> after the code above is run:<br>
